# MCGO-API
The developer api for my MCGO plugin! https://github.com/TKDKid1000/MCGO
Looking to add extra guns to MCGO? Or maybe a splat grenade to splatcraft? This is where you should be!
The MCGO dev api has *tons* of features to interact with the MCGO plugin. You can add guns to the `/mcgo guns` command,
create new melee weapons, and tons more! Check out the wiki pages for information on how to use the api,
and for a rough setup example look below:

package com.example.mcgo;

import io.github.tkdkid1000.Gun;
